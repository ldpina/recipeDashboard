## Notes

I had 2 main challenges while building this app, one was trying to figue out how to work with recharts but after going over the  documentation for a while I was able to figure it out. Another was filtering out unwanted stuff in the summary of recipies, a lot of the summaries are done in html and are all not foramted the same so some summaries look wacky but give the basic information needed to know more about the dish.
